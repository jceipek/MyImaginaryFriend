# My Imaginary Friend Book 1 - The Red Thread Murders

Susan Gable is your run-of-the-mill 15 year old raised by the internet.
Playful, self-confident, and definitely _much_ smarter than the grownups who tend
to ruin the fun more than anything else. And her father's a police detective. Oh, and you're her imaginary friend.
Did I forget to mention that? Ok, maybe she's not quite so typical after all.
